JavaScript explanation based on my understanding...

# What is JavaScript ??
  In simple words JS is programming language with the following functionality: 
  
  * High-Level: JS is a high level programming language. Unlike other languages, JS don't have to manage the memory
    or explicitly command the CPU. SO, JS do not have to manage resources.
    
  * Prototype-based Object-Oriented: Everything in Js is object except primitive datatypes like string and numbers. 
    And when we are using array.push method  
  
  * Multy-paradigm: JS supports all the type of programming approch so it is Multy paradigm language.
    i.e. 1) Functional programming 2) Object oriented programming 3) Procedural programming
  
  * Interpreted (just-in-time compiled): Computer understand only machine code (0s and 1s). So we have to first compile 
    the code and after that convert code into machine code. In JS there is JS Engine which do this both task for us. 
    In other languages compilation and execution both process are done one by one but in JS, JS engine first compiles 
    program and then imideatly executes the code so we called JS as interpreted or Just-in-time compiled language. 
    
  * dynamic 
  * single-threaded
  * garbage-collected: When we write a code it's possible that some variables are taking space in the memory while we don't 
    require them at all. So, with this functionallity JS automaticly clear the spaces in the memory which is not currently in use.
   * First-class functions
   * Non-blocking event loop concurrency model.
